            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p>Terraria is a sandbox adventure game developed by the company Re-Logic and was released for Microsoft Windows on the 16th of May in 2011. Dubbed the “2D Minecraft”, it’s a game of survival and creative building. You get to customise and explore a vast land (picking from a small, medium or large world) and fight off evil (the Corruption or Crimson biomes) in order to reach the ultimate end goal, defeating the Moon Lord (the end game boss).</p>

                This game has been out for a while. The team is well past the debut of their creative baby, but being the good parents they are, these devs continue to nurture and support their creation. This game, to this day, is still getting new content after all these years.” -2021 Steam Awards.
