            <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
        <ul id="info">
            <li>Re-Logic were in the works of a new game, a spin-off or “sequel” of Terraria called “Terraria: Otherworld” but ultimately cancelled it due to wanting to branch off from Terraria and pursue brand new projects.</li>
            <br><li>Journey’s End is Terraria’s last and final update, with 9 years after launch, the game is finally complete. It took Re-Logic 4 years of consideration and development to release it, which in turn made it one of Terraria’s biggest and most anticipated events since its launch in 2011.</li>
            <br><li> Re-Logic and Mojang (Minecraft’s developer and publisher) have quite an interesting friendship, as sometimes when you launch Minecraft, one of the few splash texts on the title menu says, “Also try Terraria!”. The same happens vice versa, when you launch Terraria, one of the few texts it can say next to the title in the GUI is “Also try Minecraft!”.</li>
            <br><li>Additionally, during Halloween, one of the costumes you can get in Goodie Bag drops is the Creeper costume!</li>

            <h1>Reviews</h1>
        <ul id="info">
            <li>“My friend bought this as a gift for my birthday. Best gift I have ever received. 10/10.” -Axerious</li>
            <br><li>“The amount of content in this game is staggering. No matter what kind of play style you choose, there's a plethora of choices and rewards to be had. There aren't many games that I'd replay over, but Terraria is one of them.” -Joopy</li>
            <br><li>“Probably the most fun you can get for $10 on the entire Steam platform. Truly incredible game that never fails to be a blast with friends.” -Puresh</li>
            <br><li>“I've played this game quite a lot, did multiple runs on different difficulties. Personally, I feel like this game is an absolute unit of a sandbox-survival genre: the ability to play with friends, to try new builds and to encounter limited, but nevertheless very hard challenges - all this is simply astonishing. For a game that's been on the market for quite a while it's huge. Replayability is in my opinion very limited, but with each update or new mod (or update) the start of a new adventure is inevitable. Thus, I have no doubts to recommend this beautiful piece of gaming to any fellow gamer coming by!” -Asgorath</li><br>
